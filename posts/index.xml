      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a while now, I have been wanting to learn a foreign language. However, I never actually dedicated any time to it. So finally, this year, I decided take it seriously and began learning Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why choose Spanish of all the languages in the world, you ask? Partly because it is English-adjacent, making it much easier to learn compared to a language such as Japanese or Mandarin, which have their own writing systems. And partly because it is also one of the most spoken languages in the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Firstly, apologies for the cliched title. I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist &amp;#x1f63a;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have lost count of the number of times I have started a blog, only for me to give up on it later. And yet, here I am, trying once again.&#xA;Well, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein&#34;&gt;somebody&lt;/a&gt; smart did once say —&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
