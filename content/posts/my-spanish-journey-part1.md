For a while now, I have been wanting to learn a foreign language. However, I never actually dedicated any time to it. So finally, this year, I decided take it seriously and began learning Spanish.

Why choose Spanish of all the languages in the world, you ask? Partly because it is English-adjacent, making it much easier to learn compared to a language such as Japanese or Mandarin, which have their own writing systems. And partly because it is also one of the most spoken languages in the world.

I am writing this post about 4 months into my learning journey. My plan is to document it so that I can share my experience, my approach, and resources, and also to hold myself accountable.

## Apps
These are the apps that I currently use, which provide a structured/guided approach to learning. However, these are not my primary resources, being superseded by `Comprehensible Input (CI)`, which I will talk about in detail in the following section.

### Duolingo
Like most people learning a new language these days, I began my journey with [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/). In my opinion, the green-owl definitely does a good job at getting you started, providing a quick and easy introduction to the language. Spanish is also by far Duolingo's most detailed course. However, after using it for a while, you realize that you can never become fluent in a language with it as your primary resource. It is a bit too gamified and simplistic for that. These days, I mostly use Dulingo as a way to practice and maintain my streak (_the marketing gimmick does work_).

### Busuu
[Busuu](https://www.busuu.com/) is another app I came across recently. It has a lot of similarities with Duolingo in the way it teaches, but is a lot less gamified, has a cleaner interface, and slightly better explanations, in my opinion. I use this similarly to Duolingo to complement `CI` and understand grammar. I'm not sure how long I'll use either this or Duolingo, but I think they're helpful for now.

### Clozemaster
[Clozemaster](https://www.clozemaster.com/) is another app I discovered recently. It's primary approach to teaching is by having you answer `fill-in-the-blank` style sentences using spaced-repetition. What I like about this is that, it allows me to learn vocabulary contextually, instead of blindly memorizing words. You could technically use [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) and create your own cloze-style cards, but it's a lot more tedious. However, if you're someone that can put in the effort, I think Anki comes out on top due to the customizability and features it provides.

## Comprehensible Input (CI)
I think I first came across [`CI`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_hypothesis/) in one of my YouTube recommendations, which led me down the rabbit-hole of Google searches and reddit posts. `CI` essentially refers to a method of learning languages via input that you can understand, even if you don't grasph 100% of the words or grammatical structures within it. In many ways it is akin to how a child learns a language growing up — by continuously being exposed to and immersed in it.

While there are purists out there who think that `CI` should be the only way to learn, I disagree. On the other hand, I find that `CI` works extremely well when complemented with some structured resources.

### Dreaming Spanish (DS)
[Dreaming Spanish](https://www.dreamingspanish.com/) is a fantastic and easily the most comprehensive resource for Spanish `CI` available on the internet. It features several teachers who create videos about interesting topics across fluency levels — from `superbeginner` to `intermediate` to `advanced`.

The initial videos require a bit of effort to sit through, which is not a fault of the platform. There's only so much exciting content you can create with basic vocabulary. But as you progress, you can definitely feel your comprehension improve. Plus, once you reach an intermediate level, you can substitute this with native content. The website also supports logging hours of content that you consume externally.

I am currently almost 50 hours in my progress, or about to reach `Level 2` as `DS` calls it.

### Podcasts
There are many beginner-Spanish podcasts that can help you learn. These complement `DS`, because you can listen to them when you are unable to watch the videos such as when working out, or commuting, performing some chores. I am currently only listening to one podcast, called ¡Cuéntame!, but I plan to add more as I progress.

You can find a more detailed list in this [sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lBmLxvWJpucXhRPayfXD7CVqpMoa2tyEbZi1rFAwsFs/edit?gid=0#gid=0).

### Language Transfer (LT)
While [Language Transfer](https://www.languagetransfer.org/) is not actually `CI` given the amount of English used, I think it is fantastic complementary resource to actual `CI`. I am not even sure what the best way to describe `LT` is. It helps you think about the target language, form connections with English and overall improves your understanding. It definitely helped me understand concepts such as verb-conjugations, object pronouns, etc. much better than having to blindly memorize them.

Well, I think that's about it for now. My next update will most likely be when I hit 150 hours of `CI` or `Level 3` of `Dreaming Spanish`.

**¡Hasta luego!**
