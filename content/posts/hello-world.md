I have lost count of the number of times I have started a blog, only for me to give up on it later. And yet, here I am, trying once again.

Well, [somebody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein) smart did once say &mdash;

> The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results.

So, what am I going to write about?

Honestly, I am not sure yet. There will definitely be quite a few technical posts, as that is what I do for a living. But, I also want to write about things 
I find interesting, or just things that I think are worth sharing. 

Hope you enjoy your stay :smile:!
