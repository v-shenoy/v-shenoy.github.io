# Hi there :wave:

<img src="/dp.jpg" alt="selfie" width="350px"/>

I am currently working as a `Software Engineer III (L4)` at `Google` as part of `Feedback & Happiness Tracking Surveys (HaTS)` team. These services are leveraged by partner teams across all Google products to collect user feedback and conduct product surveys.

Previously, I worked at `Microsoft` for almost 4 years in the `Azure Functions` and the `Azure Container Apps` teams.

For my education, I graduated with a double major in `Computer Science & Mathematics` from `BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus` in July, 2021.

You can find my CV [here](../cv.pdf).

## About this website

I like reading technical blogs, discovering new & interesting open-source projects, as well as quizzing & learning about things. In that vein, this website is an attempt to write and share about things that I find interesting (not only technical). Hope you enjoy reading!
