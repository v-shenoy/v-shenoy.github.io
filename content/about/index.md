### Hi there :wave:

I am Vighnesh Shenoy, and I am a developer from India. 

![me posing in front of Matrimandir, Auroville](/about.jpg)

I graduated with a double major in Computer Science & Mathematics from BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus in July, 2021. And I am currently
working as a software engineer at Microsoft.

I used to read a lot of books before college, but I somehow lost the habit. Currently trying to pick it back up. I am a fan of 
reading manga, and watching anime. I also like to play chess, although I am not particularly good at it.

I like reading technical blogs, discovering new open-source projects, and listening to podcasts. In that vein, this website is an attempt
to write about things I find interesting (not necessarily programming related). 

I am obsessed with cats and currently have a domestic short-hair named Neo (Instagram - [@neo.pawlstoy](https://www.instagram.com/neo.pawlstoy/)).

Feel free to reach out to me if you have something interesting to talk about. My contact information is linked below.
