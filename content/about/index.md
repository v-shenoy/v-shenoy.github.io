# Hi there :wave:

I am Vighnesh Shenoy, and I am a software developer from India. 

<img src="/about.jpg" alt="desk selfie" width="350px"/>

I graduated with a double major in Computer Science & Mathematics from BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus in July, 2021. And I am currently
working as a software engineer at Microsoft.

## Unsolicited trivia about me -

I like reading technical blogs, discovering new & interesting open-source projects, occassionally listening to podcasts and quizzing. In that vein, 
this website is an attempt to write about things I find interesting (not necessarily technical).

I was an avid reader before college, but lost the habit and currently trying to pick it back up. Additionally, I am a big fan of reading manga and watching anime. My favorite manga of all time is `One Piece`. Feel free to give me book & manga recommendations.

I also like watching tv shows and my favorite tv shows of all time are `The Wire`, and `The Sopranos`.

I am a bit unhealthilty obsessed with chess, although I am not all that good at it. Feel free to send me a challenge. I also like to keep up with a variety
of sports (albeit very casually) such as football, F1, cricket, tennis, and am a nerd for stats.

I am obsessed with cats and live with an adorable domestic short-hair named Neo (Instagram - [@the.catrix_](https://www.instagram.com/the.catrix_/)).

Feel free to reach out to me if you have something interesting to talk about. My contact information is linked below.
