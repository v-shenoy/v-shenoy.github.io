      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a while now, I have been wanting to learn a foreign language. However, I never actually dedicated any time to it. So finally, this year, I decided take it seriously and began learning Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why choose Spanish of all the languages in the world, you ask? Partly because it is English-adjacent, making it much easier to learn compared to a language such as Japanese or Mandarin, which have their own writing systems. And partly because it is also one of the most spoken languages in the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
